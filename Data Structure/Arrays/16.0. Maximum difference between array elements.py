# Given an array arr[] of N integers, the task is to
# find the maximum difference between any two elements of the array.

# max diff is always between maximum number and minimum number in array.
# so the idea is basically find the max and min number.
# we can sort the array and find min and max from first and last position,
# but sort would take NlogN.

# We can solve it in O(N) time complexity using simple for loop.
